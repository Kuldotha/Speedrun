## Turn structure
The game is played out in several rounds made up of several phases. 

### Planning Phase
The first phase is the Planning Phase. In this phase, you need to select a meneuver for each ship. You will have to think ahead because you won't know what your opponents will do before you both have sumbitted your maneuvers! After both players have commited their maneuvers, the game will execute them and go to the next phase.

### Action Phase
The second phase is where ships can do things other then move around. You can fire at your enemies or Upgrade a part of your ship. The first player will get a chance to activate one of their ships. After that, the other player will, until there are no more ships left. When all ships have been activated, we go to the next turn which again starts with the Planning Phase.

### Game End
The game ends when all ships of a team are destroyed.
